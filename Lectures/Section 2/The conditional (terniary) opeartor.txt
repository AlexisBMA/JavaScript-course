//            The conditional (Terniary) operator

const age = 23;
// The conditional is represented by '?' it is like an if-else statement. CONDITION ? IF-PART : ELSE-PART
age >= 18 ? console.log("I like to drink wine! ğŸ˜œ") : console.log("I like to drink water...");

const drink = age >= 18 ? 'wine!!' : 'water...';
console.log(drink);

// It is the same as do this
let drink2;
if (age >= 18) {
    drink2 = 'wine!!';
} else {
    drink2 = 'water...';
}
console.log(drink2);

// Since the terniary operator is an expression we can use it in a template literal
console.log(`I like to drink ${age >= 18 ? 'wine!!' : 'water...'}`);
