// By default it is a good practice to use const all the time and only use let when we are sure that the value will change at some point.

// We use let to declare variables that can change later in the execution. In javaScript reasign a value to a variable is called mutate the variable. It is bloc scoped.

let age = 30;
age = 31;


// We use const to declare variables that are not supposed to change at any point. We cannot declare empty const variables.

const birthYear = 1999;
// This is not possible:
// birthYear = 1990;
// const job;


// Using var it is not recommended. It is function scoped.
var job = 'programmer';
job = 'teacher';
